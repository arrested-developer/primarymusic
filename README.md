> An app to build KS2 maths skills through the exciting medium of music

## Our project journey

We designed this in two sprints - a 1 week design sprint followed by a 2 week build sprint.

### Empathising

### Hypotheses

* Children starting Year 3 lack basic music skills.
* Primary teachers struggle to get music teaching into the timetable
* Parents would like to do music-based activities with their child(ren)
* Teachers would find it helpful to use an app to teach these skills
* Children might need to share a device between 5-6

### Research

#### Secondary Research

* [BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/subjects/z7tnvcw) has activities aimed at KS1
* https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/08/best-music-apps-for-kids
* [Research paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00103/full) about the positive effect on children of learning music
    * More accessible [news article](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180326140244.htm) about the research

* [Good article containing examples of maths-music teaching content](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/math-music-movement/)
* [Files containing maths learning objectives for years 1-6](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/new-curriculum-maths-objectives-for-years-1-6-6441395) - if we decide to link maths & music this could be good for seeing what kind of maths skills we want to aiming for, and would help us see how music can be used to demonstrate/practice specific skills (e.g. counting: beats, fractions: octaves)
* [Lesson plan](https://www.teachervision.com/logic-problem-solving/patterns-music-math) relating musical patterns to mathematical patterns (e.g. AB patterns and odd & even numbers)
* [Research linking music skills and language skills](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5078758/)

### User Interviews

**Teachers**

1. What ages did you teach?
2. What's your experience of supply teaching been like?
3. Do you get asked to teach music as supply teacher?
4. What have your experiences been of music education in different schools?
5. As a full-time teacher, did you have time to teach music?
6. Have you used a scheme of work to teach music? How did you find it?
7. How would you plan a music lesson?
8. Did you like to teach music? Why/why not?
9. Are there things that work well/don't work well in your music lessons?
10. What aspects of music did the class enjoy?
11. How do you feel about using apps during lessons?
12. What IT resources do/could you have available when teaching music? Would you consider using an app?

### User Testing Interview

**Tasks:**
* Choose the Numdrum game and begin playing
* When they finish playing, go back to the main menu
* Choose another game, begin playing, then go back to the main menu partway through

**User profile:**
* 6-8 year-olds
* Teachers & parents of 6-8 year-olds

### Synthesising

* Are the characters too childish for the desired audience? One user said they were perhaps more 'CBeebies' than 'CBBC'. Here's some current animated shows: 
    * Adventure Time
    * Spongebob
    * Tinkershrimp & Dutch
    * TMNT
    * Danger Mouse Super Awesome Danger Squad
* Does the Shapesong game need to be finessed in its description - people found this the most complicated to 'get'
* Users found navigating the menus and games straightforward
* Overall, the 'intro' screen to exlain is a nice touch

## Pivot

User research showed that the app's design was too childish and would risk being seriously uncool to streetwise 7 year olds. We redesigned the characters and focused the game on one activity - drumming.
